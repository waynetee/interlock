# Multi-Port Ethernet Bring-Up: Findings and References

This document collects what we've learned during the multi-port (CORETSE_0
+ CORETSE_1) Ethernet bring-up on the MPF300-EVAL-KIT. Captured because
much of this is hard to assemble from any single source — the relevant
information is spread across encrypted IP wrappers, half-documented
register pages, and forum threads.

### CoreTSE soft MAC IP

- **CoreTSE v3.2 User Guide DS50003245C** — IP-level documentation.
  PDF: <https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/ip_cores/directcores/CoreTSE_UG.pdf>
  - §1.10 MDIO Management — describes the IP's MDIO master + internal slave
  - §3.1 MAC Core Registers — register map (TSE_BASEADDR + 0x000-0x044)
  - §3.5 SGMII/TBI/1000Base-X Registers (Indirect Addressing through MDIO)
    — registers accessible at the internal slave address (MDIO_PHYID)
  - §4.1 Ports — pin descriptions (notably MDC = output only, no MDC input)
  - §4.2 Configuration Parameters — defines `MDIO_PHYID` (range 0-31,
    default 18) as "MDIO Physical Address"

- **CoreTSE Handbook DS50003245E** — newer handbook covering the same IP.
  PDF: <https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/ip_cores/directcores/CoreTSE_HB.pdf>
  Confirms MDI/MDO/MDOEN are all in the PCLK clock domain (no external

### VSC8575 PHY chip

- **VMDS-10457 (VSC8575-11 datasheet)** Rev 4.2 — the authoritative source
  on the PHY chip side.
  Product page (with datasheet link): <https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/vsc8575-11>
  - **§3.1 Operating Modes** — Table 1 lists supported MAC↔Media mode
    combinations. SGMII MAC ↔ 10/100/1000BASE-T copper is what we use.
  - **§3.1.1.1 MAC Interface SGMII** — explicit register-level setup
    required for SGMII MAC mode:
    > "• Set register 19G bits 15:14 = 00
    >  • Set Register 23 (main register) bit 12 = 0
    >  • Set Register 18G = 0x80F0"
  - **§3.2 SerDes MAC Interface** — clarifies the global vs per-port nature:
    > "Register 19G is a global register and needs to be set once to
    >  configure the device to the desired mode. The other register bits
    >  are configured on a per-port basis and the operation either needs
    >  to be repeated for each port, or a broadcast write needs to be
    >  used by setting register 22, bit 0 to configure all the ports
    >  simultaneously."
  - **§4.2.28 (Table 68) Extended/GPIO Register Page Access** —
    authoritative table for register-31 page values:

    | Value | Page |
    |---|---|
    | 0x0000 | Main (default) |
    | 0x0001 | Extended page 1 (E1) |
    | 0x0002 | Extended page 2 (E2) |
    | 0x0003 | Extended page 3 (E3) |
    | 0x0010 | GPIO page (= "G" suffix) |

  - **§4.7 General Purpose Registers** — describes the GPIO/G page register
    map. Notable registers:
    - 18G (Table 118) "Microprocessor Command Register":
      - 0x80F0 = "Enable four MAC SGMII ports"
      - 0x80E0 = "Enable four MAC QSGMII ports"
      - 0x8FC1 = "Enable four Media 1000BASE-X ports"
      - 0x8FD1 = "Enable four Media 100BASE-FX ports"
    - 19G (Table 119) "MAC Mode and Fast Link Configuration":
      - bits 15:14 = 00 → SGMII, 01 → QSGMII, others reserved
  - **§4.7.7 Microprocessor Command** — operational notes:
    > "Bit 15 tells the internal processor to execute the command. When
    >  bit 15 is cleared the command has completed. ... Bit 14 = 1
    >  typically indicates an error condition where the squelch patch
    >  was not loaded. ... Commands may take up to 25 ms to complete."
  - **§4.2.21 (Table 61) Extended PHY Control 1 (register 23)** — per-port
    register; bit 12 selects SGMII (0) vs 1000BASE-X (1) at the per-port
    level. Note: "Register 19G.15:14 must be = 00 for this selection to
    be valid." This bit is **super-sticky** (survives software reset);
    a software reset (register 0 bit 15) is needed to commit mode changes.

### Linux kernel mscc driver

Production driver for the VSC85xx PHY family. Authoritative
cross-reference for any VSC PHY register-access details.

- mscc.h (constants): <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/drivers/net/phy/mscc/mscc.h>
- mscc_main.c (main driver): <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/drivers/net/phy/mscc/mscc_main.c>
- Driver source tree: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/phy/mscc>

`drivers/net/phy/mscc/mscc.h` confirms the page values:

```c
#define MSCC_EXT_PAGE_ACCESS              31     // the page-select register
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_STANDARD            0x0000
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_EXTENDED            0x0001
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_EXTENDED_2          0x0002
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_EXTENDED_3          0x0003
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_EXTENDED_4          0x0004
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_EXTENDED_GPIO       0x0010   // "G" suffix lives here
#define MSCC_PHY_PAGE_1588                0x1588
```

And confirms that the SGMII/QSGMII MAC interface mode is selected via
register 19 on the GPIO page (= 19G):

```c
#define MSCC_PHY_MAC_CFG_FASTLINK         19      // register address on GPIO page
#define MAC_CFG_MASK                      0xc000  // bits 15:14
#define MAC_CFG_SGMII                     0x0000  // matches VSC8575 datasheet
#define MAC_CFG_QSGMII                    0x4000
#define MAC_CFG_RGMII                     0x8000
```

This is the same as the datasheet's 19G[15:14] description but lets us
cross-check the page mapping definitively.

### Microchip demo guides (multi-instance hints)

- **DG0633 IGLOO2 CoreTSE MAC 1000 Base-T Loopback Demo** (single-port
  demo) — contains the only explicit Microchip statement we've found on
  multi-instance CoreTSE:
  > "Multiple CoreTSE MAC IPs can be used in IGLOO2 to achieve Ethernet
  >  solutions. CoreTSE MAC can be used in SmartFusion2 devices along
  >  with MSS Ethernet MAC to support multiple Ethernet interfaces."

  PDF: <https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemdocuments/documents/fpga/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/m2gl_dg0633_core_tse_mac_1000_baset_loopback_v1.pdf>

  But DG0633 itself is single-instance and doesn't show how. It punts to
  AC423 for details.

- **DG0637 SmartFusion2 CoreTSE_AHB 1000 Base-T Loopback Demo** — sister
  demo for SmartFusion2. Echoes the DG0633 multi-instance language
  verbatim. Same situation: single-port demo, no example.
  PDF: <https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/FPGA/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/microsemi_smartfusion2_coretse_ahb_1000_baset_loopback_demo_guide_dg0637.pdf>

- **AC423 SmartFusion2/IGLOO2 Ethernet Solutions Application Note** — the
  document Microchip explicitly cites for multi-instance details. **Could
  not retrieve automatically — Microchip CDN returns HTTP 403 to
  non-browser fetches.** Worth getting via a logged-in browser session.
  Doc portal: <https://www.microsemi.com/document-portal/doc_details/134017-ac423-smartfusion2-soc-fpga-and-igloo2-fpga-ethernet-solutions-application-note>

- **AN4623** — single-port Ethernet bring-up reference design our firmware
  is derived from. Provides working port-0 init code.
  Product page (with download link): <https://www.microchip.com/en-us/application-notes/an4623>

- **DG0799 PolarFire 1G Ethernet IOD CDR Demo** — PolarFire-specific
  single-SGMII ethernet demo. Useful reference for PF_IOD_CDR usage.
  Product page: <https://www.microchip.com/en-us/application-notes/dg0799>

### Microchip support articles (relevant but blocked)

Both returned HTTP 403 to automated fetches; worth retrieving via a
browser session if we keep debugging:

- **MDIO interface on the CoreSGMII**:
  <https://microchip.my.site.com/s/article/MDIO-interface-on-the-CoreSGMII>
- **Connecting multiple PHYs to one MDIO bus**:
  <https://microchip.my.site.com/s/article/Connecting-multiple-PHYs-to-one-MDIO--Management-Data-Input-Output--bus>

### Other relevant findings

- **`polarfire-soc-video-kit-reference-design`** on GitHub — closest
  multi-link PolarFire example we found. It uses **CoreSGMII + MSS GEM**
  with **two separate MDIO buses** (one per MAC), not two CoreTSE soft
  IPs on a shared bus. Microchip's published reference pattern when they
  want two MACs talking to PHYs is **bus separation**, not sharing.

  - TSN top-level wiring (two separate MDIO buses):
    <https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-video-kit-reference-design/blob/master/script_support/components/TSN/VKPFSOC_TSN.tcl>
  - CoreSGMII instantiation with `MDIO_PHYID:18`:
    <https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-video-kit-reference-design/blob/master/script_support/components/TSN/CORESGMII_C0.tcl>

- **`polarfire-soc` GitHub Discussion #211** ("Using both Ethernet ports on
  Icicle kit") notes the Icicle kit's two MSS GEMs share a single MDIO
  bus to the dual-port PHY, and "you can use them one at a time, but
  not both at the same time" — a precedent that even Microchip's hardware
  designs back away from concurrent multi-MAC + shared MDIO.
  URL: <https://github.com/orgs/polarfire-soc/discussions/211>

### Open-source MAC alternatives (if we abandon dual-CoreTSE)

- **alexforencich/verilog-ethernet** — production-quality 1G/10G Ethernet
  MAC + UDP/IP stack in pure Verilog, BSD-licensed, widely used (Corundum
  NIC, others). Would replace CORETSE_1 if we pivot to CoreSGMII + open MAC.
  Repo: <https://github.com/alexforencich/verilog-ethernet>

- **secworks/sha256** — well-tested SHA-256 core for future attestation
  work (BSD).
  Repo: <https://github.com/secworks/sha256>

- **secworks/hmac** — HMAC wrapper around the SHA-256 core (BSD).
  Repo: <https://github.com/secworks/hmac>

## Key facts established empirically

### What we have confirmed works

- **CORETSE_0 alone, single-port**: works completely. PHY 18 (its internal
  PCS slave) responds with `status = 0x017D` after autoneg, link bit
  set, autoneg-done bit set.

- **VSC8575 ports 28/29/30/31 all respond on MDIO**: every PHY 28-31 returns
  valid PHY ID (`0x0007 / 0x07D1` = the OUI for Vitesse/Microsemi).

- **VSC8575 port 0 and port 1 copper links** both come up. `status = 0x79ED`
  on both, link=1, autoneg complete=1.

- **CORETSE_1's MAC layer works**: MAC_CONFIG_1 reads back as 0x0F after
  init (= TXEN+SYNCED_TXEN+RXEN+SYNCED_RXEN), proving APB CSR access and
  MAC sync are functional.

### What we have NOT been able to make work

- **CORETSE_1's internal MDIO slave at PHY 19** returns `0xFFFF` on every
  read. Symptom unchanged across:
  - Different SmartDesign configurations (single component instantiated
    twice; two separate components with different MDIO_PHYID values; wrapper
    Verilog parameterization attempts)
  - Connecting MDI to the shared bus (vs leaving it tied to GND)
  - Adding `mdio_combiner` to route CORETSE_1's MDO/MDOEN back onto the bus
  - Six bitstream rebuilds with various combinations of the above

## What we've ruled out

| Hypothesis | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| MDIO_PHYID parameter not propagating | **Ruled out**. Synth log shows two distinct parameter-specialized variants `ACT_UNIQUE_CORETSE_TOP_..._18s_0s` and `..._19s_0s`. |
| Synthesizer collapsing instances | **Ruled out**. Same as above — Synplify keeps two distinct instances with different parameter values. |
| Bus contention from second master | **Ruled out**. CORETSE_1's master is unused (MDC tied off, MDO/MDOEN routed only as slave response path). |
| Bridge wiring asymmetry between ports | **Ruled out**. Verified all clocks, resets, MDI connections symmetric between CORETSE_0 and CORETSE_1. |
| CORETSE_1's slave can't drive bus (no MDO/MDOEN) | **Tested (sub-PR #9)** — added mdio_combiner so slave response can reach BIBUF. No change. |

## Still open (current best hypotheses, iter-3 testing now)

### Hypothesis A — VSC8575 missing package-level SGMII init

The VSC8575 datasheet explicitly requires writes to 19G (global) and 18G
(microprocessor command 0x80F0) to put the chip in 4-port SGMII MAC mode.
Until iter-3, we never made these writes. Port 0 might work because the
chip's reset defaults are SGMII-ish for port 0, but ports 1-3 might not
be fully active without the explicit init.

If true: PHY 19 should now respond after iter-3.

### Hypothesis B — Squelch patch not loaded

The VSC8575 has an 8051 microcontroller running ROM firmware. Microchip
provides "patches" loaded over MDIO that fix ROM bugs. The Linux mscc
driver loads these patches (`vsc8584_micro_assert_reset` etc.); we don't.

Per §4.7.7 of the datasheet, the 18G microprocessor command sets bit 14
on completion if "the squelch patch was not loaded." Iter-3 explicitly
checks this bit and logs it.

If bit 14 = 1: we need to load the firmware patch, which is a ~10 KB
binary blob loaded over MDIO into the chip's RAM. Significant additional
firmware work.

### Hypothesis C — CoreTSE eval-tier multi-instance limitation

The IP is IEEE 1735 encrypted. The CoreTSE User Guide is silent on
multi-instance use. DG0633 says multi-instance "can be used" but provides
no example. The encrypted RTL might have implicit single-instance
assumptions even though MDIO_PHYID is correctly parameterized at the
synth level.

If true: iter-3's spec-compliant VSC8575 init is irrelevant; PHY 19 stays
silent because the CoreTSE_1 PCS subsystem doesn't fully activate.

### Hypothesis D — Slave needs explicit MDC

The CoreTSE MDIO slave might be implemented to sample MDI on its own
master's MDC. If CORETSE_1's master is idle (no firmware APB writes),
its internal MDC isn't toggling and the slave can't decode bus traffic
from CORETSE_0's master.

We considered this earlier but the handbook's port-domain listing
(MDI/MDO/MDOEN all in PCLK clock domain, no MDC input) implies PCLK
oversampling rather than MDC sampling. Plausible but probably not the
issue.

## Iteration log

| Iter | Approach | Result |
|---|---|---|
| #1 | AN4623 single-port baseline | Port 0 works |
| #3 | Sub-PR #3: second CoreTSE instance with internal loopback | Built, port 1 isolated |
| #4 | Sub-PR #4: bidirectional bridge wiring | Built, no functional test yet |
| #5 | Sub-PR #5: debug LEDs | Built, port 0 works, port 1 silent |
| iter-2 fw | Port-1 firmware mirroring port 0 | Built, PHY 19 = 0xFFFF |
| #8 | Sub-PR #8: distinct CoreTSE component for CORETSE_1, MDIO_PHYID=19 | Built (with Synplify `-allow_duplicate_modules`), PHY 19 still 0xFFFF |
| #9 | Sub-PR #9: mdio_combiner module | Built, PHY 19 still 0xFFFF |
| iter-3 fw | + VSC8575 4-port SGMII config + diagnostic probes | **Building now** |

## What to look at if iter-3 doesn't fix it

The diagnostic prints in iter-3 will narrow the failure mode. Specifically:

- `[vsc] 18G post-cmd=0x????` — if bit 14 set, squelch patch needed
- `[pcs] PHY19 ...` indicator bits — if i=00 (clean read of 0xFFFF), slave
  isn't engaging; if i=04 (NOT_VALID), master is timing out
- Compare PHY 19 indicator bits to PHY 17 (unused negative control) — if
  identical, PHY 19 is "fully silent like nothing-at-all"

If we're stuck after iter-3, the remaining strategic options:

1. **Load the VSC8575 firmware patch** — significant work but well-documented
   in the Linux mscc driver.

2. **Pivot to CoreSGMII + alexforencich MAC for port 1** — replaces the
   encrypted CoreTSE-multi-instance unknown with a known-good open-source
   stack. ~1-2 weeks.

3. **Passive observer architecture** — single CORETSE for Mac side, Spark
   connects directly to Mac, FPGA observes via fabric tap. Eliminates
   second-port problem entirely. Most aligned with interlock's actual
   threat model.

4. **Retrieve AC423** — the document Microchip explicitly cites for
   multi-instance CoreTSE configuration. Couldn't fetch automatically;
   needs a browser session.

## File-by-file reference

### Gateware (Libero / SmartDesign Tcl)

- `gateware/src/src_components/CORETSE_0.tcl` — primary CoreTSE component,
  MDIO_PHYID=18 (default)
- `gateware/src/src_components/CORETSE_1.tcl` — second CoreTSE component,
  MDIO_PHYID=19 (NEW in sub-PR #8)
- `gateware/src/src_components/top.tcl` — SmartDesign top wiring
- `gateware/src/src_hdl/mdio_combiner.sv` — wire-OR for two CoreTSE slaves
  to share one MDIO bus (NEW in sub-PR #9)
- `gateware/src/4_implement_design.tcl` — synthesis config; carries
  `SYNPLIFY_OPTIONS:set_option -allow_duplicate_modules 1` (NEW in sub-PR
  #8) so Synplify accepts two CoreTSE.v files with identical encrypted
  sub-module names

### Firmware

- `gateware/src/src_softconsole/main.c` — Mi-V firmware. Iter-3 adds
  `vsc8575_init()`, `mdio_read_v()`, `dump_pcs()`.
- `gateware/src/src_softconsole/iog_cdr.hex` — baked into bitstream at
  build time; must be regenerated whenever main.c changes (SoftConsole
  build then objcopy with `--change-section-lma '*-0x80000000'`).

### Documentation

- `docs/firmware-iteration.md` — fast iteration via JTAG (currently not
  fully working — but useful reference for SoftConsole setup)
- `docs/iter-3-diagnostics-DRAFT.patch` — earlier draft of the diagnostic
  additions, now applied directly in iter-3.
- This file (`docs/multi-port-ethernet-findings.md`) — what you're
  reading.
