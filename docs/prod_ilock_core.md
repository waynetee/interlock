# Production Interlock Core Design Specification

This document describes the **production interlock core** — the full-duplex bump-in-the-wire implementing the interlock device role of `verification-protocol.md`: canonical checking, traffic commitment, bucket buffering, and once-per-second attestation. It covers how the core is deployed and why the blocks compose the way they do; block internals live in their own docs.

* drop: a separate axis_pkt_gate after canon proc

## Deployment — bump in the wire

The core sits between two CoreTSE MAC client interfaces on a single fabric clock (the M\*CLK domain — the MAC FIFOs handle the line-side CDC). Port 0 faces the **client** (prover frontend, the outside region), port 1 the **server** (prover compute, the inside region).ß

The endpoints' side of the contract:

- speak **canonical packets**, one per Ethernet frame (a packet must fit the frame's DATA field);
- stamp each packet with the **current bucket**, tracked from the sync packets arriving on the sender's own ingress wire (`FIRST_ARR` calibration — see the canon doc);
- keep **IDs monotonic** (per session inbound, per bucket outbound — the prover pre-sorts);
- inject the verifier's **nonce** as the reserved `ID = 0` control packet on the request path;
- leave room for the spliced-in streams — **certificates** on the response egress, **sync packets** on both — by reserving their bandwidth on the fill side (see below);
- treat drops as silent — there is no error path by design; recovery is a new request after timeout.

## Region split — commit on the outside edge

The dashed boundary in the diagram is the organizing decision: the **bucket buffer is the only block that crosses it**; every other block sits on one edge. In particular, both `traffic_commit` instances sit on the **outside** edge — requests are committed at **arrival** (before buffering), responses at **egress** (after buffering) — so INWARD and OUTWARD both describe the byte stream **on the external wire**, the stream the verifier can observe and challenge. This is why the two directions order their blocks differently.

The asymmetry cascades into the drop handling:

- **Request side** — `canon → gate → commit → buffer`. The commitment precedes the buffer, and it commits exactly what it forwards, so a payload-flagged packet must be squashed *before* it: that is the sole purpose of the separate `axis_pkt_gate`, which consumes canon's drop flag.
- **Response side** — `canon → buffer → commit`. No gate: the buffer's commit/abandon consumes the drop flag natively, and the commitment then sees only verified drained records — including the effect of any drain preemption, so the digest matches what actually left toward the wire.

## Inline Bucket marker flow and tuser

Each direction's bucket marker originates in its `canon_proc` and must reach every downstream block that groups by bucket, then stop. The per-instance `OUTPUT_SWAP` values encode exactly that.

`tuser` along the whole path is the total length at beat #0; the drop flag exists only on the one hop out of each `canon_proc`.

## Shared bucket clock

A single free-running timer paces the whole device: `TIMER_END = 79_999` → a 1 ms bucket at the 80 MHz fabric clock, `BKTS_PER_CERT = 1000` → one certificate per second. Its tick fans out to both canons (bucket check, marker insertion, sync emission) and both buffers (drain retarget); every bucket index in the device — both directions' checks, both digests' grouping, the certificate tiling — derives from this one counter, which is what makes a single certificate meaningful across both directions. The buffers' grace periods absorb each side's upstream tail: 2000 cycles on the request side (the gate and commit lengthen the path), 1000 on the response side.

## Control paths

- **Nonce** — the request-side canon latches `KEY_COMMIT` of the `ID = 0` packet and drives `cert_build.in_nonce` continuously; the response-side canon's nonce output is unused (no `KEY_COMMIT` in that header).
- **Sync** — each canon's sync packet is spliced into the **opposite** direction's egress mux: feedback toward that direction's sender. The request egress carries {requests, response-side sync}; the response egress carries {responses, certificate, request-side sync}.
- **Certificate** — a message pairs the two commits' hash pulses with the latched nonce and emits toward the client on the response egress.

## Sync packet and Certificate egress — bandwidth reservation

The certificate interleaves onto the wire stream. The mux can never *create* a gap in a saturated packet stream: if real packets fill every slot, there is nowhere to splice the cert. The reservation is therefore made **upstream, on the fill side**: the source periodically inserts gaps or frames deliberately constructed for dropping; the fill side discards them via checks already in place, leaving a hole in the drained stream.
