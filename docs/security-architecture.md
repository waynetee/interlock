# Security architecture — the network logging device and process

This document is the security architecture for the **interlock**: the network
logging device that sits on a compute node's only network path, and the
surrounding process (prover logging, verifier challenges) that turns its
output into verified statements about the node's traffic.

It complements the existing docs rather than replacing them:

- `verification-protocol.md` — the protocol itself (objects, challenge flow,
  recomputation options).
- `prod_ilock_core.md`, `prod_canon_proc.md` — the production core's block
  designs (further block detail lives in the RTL headers under
  `gateware/src/src_hdl/`).
- `ethernet-frame-sanitization.md` — the per-field 802.3 sanitization rules.
- `recomp_ilock_core.md`, `recomp_feed.md` — the recomputation interlock.
- `gateware-crypto-backend.md` — key custody and side-channel decisions.

Implementation references are to the **production core on `main`**
(`gateware/src/src_hdl/`: `fabric_bridge` and its blocks). An earlier
conformance core (`gateware/src/core/` on `feature/gateware-core`) validated
the certificate pipeline byte-for-byte against the Python golden model; it is
superseded by the production line but remains the cross-checked reference for
the hash/certificate math.

Terminology note: this document uses **epoch** for the certificate window
(`N` buckets; one certificate per epoch — 1 s / 1000 × 1 ms buckets in the
production parameters: `TIMER_END = 79_999` at the 80 MHz fabric clock,
`BKTS_PER_CERT = 1000`). The other docs call this the "cert window" or
"second".

## 1. Objective and trust boundary

A compute node (the **prover's** hardware) is *quarantined*: every byte it
exchanges with the outside world crosses the interlock, and nothing else
about the node is observable from outside. The interlock makes the node's
communication **auditable after the fact** without trusting the prover: it
emits **traffic certificates** — one per epoch — each attesting to exactly
which packets traversed the device during that epoch, represented by
per-packet commitments, and signed by an on-device secret key shared only
with the **verifier**.

| Party | Trust status | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Interlock** | Trusted for enforcement; assumed correct logic, tamper-proof state, secret key | HMAC key `k`, bucket timer, running hash state + one bucket buffer per direction. Stores no history. |
| **Prover** (frontend + compute) | Untrusted; physically hosts the interlock | Full traffic logs, payload keys, weights |
| **Verifier** | Trusted by itself; remote | Shared key `k`, anchor log of nonce→certificate round trips |

The prover's physical access to the device is in scope: the threat model
includes power/EM side channels against the key and attempts to reset or
rewind device state. The verifier's end goal (property P3 of
`verification-protocol.md`) is a sound upper bound U on unexplained
information leaving the node; everything below exists so that per-packet
accounting of U is *complete* — no information leaves the quarantine outside
the committed packets.

## 2. Physical layout and device

The interlock is a Microchip **PolarFire MPF300TS** FPGA (S-grade;
MPF300-EVAL-KIT for the prototype) wired in-line on the compute node's only
network path, with one Ethernet port per side:

```
verifier ↔ prover frontend ↔ [ port 0 | PolarFire fabric | port 1 ] ↔ compute node
                                        interlock device              (quarantined)
```

- **Two 1G Ethernet ports** (VSC8575 PHYs over SGMII via IOD CDR), one
  facing the prover frontend, one facing the quarantined compute node. The
  device is the only Layer-2 endpoint either side sees; there is no other
  cable, radio, or shared medium into the quarantine.
- **All-fabric datapath.** Forwarding, hashing, buffering, and certification
  are plain SystemVerilog in FPGA fabric at an 80 MHz fabric clock — no CPU,
  no firmware, no software stack on the trusted path (the Mi-V soft CPU in
  the build serves only off-datapath PHY bring-up). The TCB is a small set
  of inspectable RTL blocks (§8).
- **On-die key security: PUF + encrypted flash.** PolarFire has no
  battery-backed key RAM; its security primitives are an **SRAM-PUF**
  (a device-unique silicon fingerprint from which key-wrapping keys are
  derived — never stored, regenerated at each power-up) and **sNVM**
  (56 KB secure flash whose pages can be PUF-encrypted and authenticated).
  The HMAC key at rest exists only as PUF-wrapped ciphertext in sNVM; the
  plaintext key exists only while powered. The same sNVM holds the persisted
  epoch counter that makes restarts non-rewinding (§7). On-chip **tamper
  detectors** (voltage, temperature, clock/JTAG monitors) can trigger
  **zeroization**, destroying the sNVM contents — key death on active
  tamper, without a battery.
- **On-die crypto hardware** (Athena TeraFire cryptoprocessor, present on
  S-grade parts) is the phase-2 home of the HMAC: validated DPA/SPA
  countermeasures against the physically-present adversary
  (`gateware-crypto-backend.md`).
- The prover hosts the device in its facility. Physical substitution
  (unplugging the interlock, routing around it) is countered by the process,
  not the box: certificates must tile the timeline under a key the prover
  never learns, so traffic that bypasses the device is traffic with no
  certificate — a violation, not an escape (§9, C1/C3).

For the recomputation option, a second interlock of the same construction
(`recomp_ilock_core`, a structural sibling of the production core) mediates
the verifier-enclosure boundary at challenge time (§6).

## 3. Timing isolation and metadata removal

Raw Ethernet between two hosts carries far more information than the
payload bytes: addresses, header quirks, padding content, inter-frame
spacing, microsecond-level send times. The interlock's first job is to
destroy every such channel, leaving only what the protocol explicitly
commits.

**Metadata removal — sanitize, terminate, re-originate.** Each port is a
full L2 endpoint, and every 802.3 field is forced to a known-good canonical
form (`ethernet-frame-sanitization.md`): DST and SRC are forced/whitelisted
to exactly one address each; the LENGTH field is enforced against the bytes
actually received (mismatch ⇒ drop); PAD is dropped where unnecessary and
overwritten with a fixed value where the 64-octet minimum requires it; the
FCS is discarded and recomputed over the sanitized frame. Only the DATA
field — the canonical packet (§4) — crosses, verbatim. One residual is
explicitly accepted rather than eliminated: frame segmentation (the LENGTH
value itself) can carry on the order of a bit per frame at a cost of ~4
unexplained bytes; it is undetectable at frame level and is charged in the
unexplained-information accounting instead (§11).

**Timing isolation — quantize egress to the bucket.** Time is divided into
1 ms buckets by a free-running on-device timer. Egress in each direction is
staged through a **ping-pong bucket buffer** (`batch_buffer.sv`): packets
accepted during bucket `b` accumulate in one bank while the other bank —
bucket `b−1`'s contents — drains to the wire; the banks swap exactly on the
tick. An admission guard accepts a packet's first beat only if enough
cycles remain before the tick (else it stalls until after the swap), so no
record straddles banks; a drain still running at the next tick is preempted
— the cut is closed and the un-emitted remainder dropped (§7). The outside
world therefore observes only **bank contents at bucket changeover points**,
never sub-bucket timing. The timing channel that remains (which bucket a
packet lands in) is explicit, committed (the in-packet bucket field, §4),
and capacity-bounded by the bucket width and the bank size.

**No side observables.** Invalid packets are silently suppressed
(header-check failures never leave `canon_proc`; payload-check failures are
gated out by `axis_pkt_gate`) — no drop counters, no status frames. (A
dropped packet never exits the node, so it needs no accounting; the prover
detects its own drops by comparing its logs on the two sides.) The
interlock's own emissions are limited to: sanitized forwarded frames,
certificates, and **sync packets**. Sync packets (one per tick, reserved
`ID = 1`) are each direction's time reference, and each is routed back
toward **that direction's own sender**: the frontend's sync carries the
arrival phase (`FIRST_ARR`) of the frontend's *own* traffic, and the compute
node's sync flows inward — so neither stream can carry compute-influenced
information outward. The certificate is exactly prover-predictable
field-for-field, so the device's total covert-output surface reduces to
nonce-latch timing (≤1 bit per nonce update) plus the HMAC tag bits
(auditable by slot-bound cut-and-choose, see `verification-protocol.md`).

The net effect, stated as the isolation invariant the rest of the document
builds on:

> **No information leaves the quarantine other than the contents of the
> ping-pong buffer at the bucket changeover points** — plus bucket-granular
> timing, which is committed and capacity-bounded.

## 4. Requests, responses, and packets

### 4.1 Packet structure

All traffic is structured as canonical packets with a fixed 64-byte
cleartext header and an end-to-end-encrypted payload the interlock never
decrypts. A canonical packet must fit a single Ethernet DATA field — no
segmentation (that is what neutralizes segmentation as a free channel).
Fields (`canon_pkg.sv`):

- **Request (in):** `pld_len ‖ bucket ‖ id ‖ reference ‖ key_commit ‖
  payload` — `key_commit = H(key material)` pins, at request time, the keys
  any later recomputation may use; `reference` points to an earlier request
  whose context this one extends (multi-turn, long inputs/outputs — chain
  logic lives entirely outside the device, which hashes the field like any
  other bytes).
- **Response (out):** `pld_len ‖ bucket ‖ id ‖ reserved ‖ payload` — a
  response binds to its request by id and inherits its context through it.

The id's LSB flags inference vs. other traffic; ids 0 and 1 are reserved
for control: an inbound **`id = 0`** packet carries a verifier **nonce**
(latched, never forwarded), **`id = 1`** marks the device's own sync
packets, and a zero header flags a certificate frame.

**Validity rules** (enforced by `canon_proc` as the packet streams through;
violators are suppressed before the buffer, or gated at `tlast` for
payload-length mismatch): payload length within range and, for inference
packets, a whole number of token units; ids strictly increasing per
direction (the response comparator resets per bucket, since responses
finish out of order); `reference` earlier than `id`; reserved fields zero;
and the declared **bucket exact-matches** the device's current bucket.

### 4.2 Packets are self-locating

The validity rules are chosen so that two in-packet fields pin each
accepted packet's position in the timeline:

- **Bucket** — accepted only on exact match with the device counter (the
  check keys directly off the tick, independent of downstream
  backpressure), so an accepted packet's recorded bucket *is* its true-time
  bucket.
- **Id** — strictly monotonic per direction within a bucket, so within a
  bucket there are no duplicate ids per direction and sorting by id
  reconstructs the exact order the device folded them. (The same response
  id may recur in *different* buckets; the bucket field disambiguates, so
  `(direction, bucket, id)` is globally unique.)

**Consequence:** the **unordered set** of accepted packet data suffices to
reconstruct the ping-pong buffer contents at every changeover point of the
epoch — group by bucket, sort by id, and the per-bucket sequences (hence
every digest in §5) are reproduced byte-exactly.

### 4.3 No undercounting: per-packet information sums correctly

Reconstruction from *unordered* data means all information in the buffer
snapshots is contained in the packets themselves — there is no residual
degree of freedom that carries information per-packet accounting would
miss:

- If within-bucket **ordering** were attacker-chosen and observable, a
  prover could encode extra bits in the permutation (log₂ n! bits per
  bucket of n packets) invisibly to per-packet accounting. Sort-by-id
  removes this freedom: any reconstructed order is a pure function of
  packet contents.
- If **bucket placement** were free, cross-bucket arrangement would be a
  channel. Exact-match declaration removes it: placement equals true
  arrival time, already accounted as the (bounded, committed) timing
  channel of §3.

So the total information crossing the boundary is exactly the **sum over
packets of their individual information content** — the quantity the
challenge protocol samples.

### 4.4 Why subsets can be queried

The structure above is what lets the verifier audit a *sample* instead of
the whole log, and still get an unbiased estimate:

- **Openable in small slices.** Commitments are hierarchical (record →
  bucket digest → epoch digest, §5), so one challenged byte opens with: one
  certificate, that epoch's bucket-digest list, one bucket's records, and
  one packet's header + `H(payload)` — a few hundred KB, no payloads.
- **Unbiased sampling.** The verifier draws uniform `(bucket y, byte x)`
  over `[B − window, B] × [0, C)`. Uniform-over-capacity is size-weighted
  sampling: every transmitted byte is equally likely to be challenged, so
  the sampled per-byte unexplained-information estimate is unbiased over
  all traffic; an `x` beyond the bucket's actual content is a cheap
  liveness check. Because packets are self-locating (§4.2), the prover
  cannot steer which packet "answers" a given `(y, x)` — cumulative lengths
  within the reconstructed bucket order determine it.
- **No undercount under sampling.** By §4.3 the total information is the
  sum of per-packet contributions, so a uniform per-byte sample scales to a
  sound whole-traffic bound; there is no mass hidden in ordering, placement,
  or unlogged observables for sampling to miss.

## 5. Certificate generation

Every epoch the device emits one certificate committing both directions,
computed incrementally as packets stream through (`traffic_commit` +
`cert_build`; nothing stored beyond the running state):

```
1. per packet:  record   = length ‖ SHA256( header ‖ H(payload) )
2. per bucket:  bucket_hash — running SHA-256 over the bucket's records
                (closed by the in-band boundary marker)
3. per epoch:   overall  — running SHA-256 over the N bucket hashes,
                one per direction (overall_req, overall_rsp)

m   = version ‖ interlock_id ‖ bucket_start ‖ num_buckets
      ‖ overall_req ‖ overall_rsp ‖ nonce ‖ prev_τ
τ   = HMAC_k(m)
certificate frame = [ zero canonical header (id = 0) ] ‖ m ‖ τ
```

Three binding layers: the **packet commitment** binds the packet data
(header — including the declared bucket, id, reference, and key commitment —
and payload, via `H(header ‖ H(payload))`); the **certificate** binds the
epoch's packet commitments and attests their integrity; the **on-device
key** makes the attestation unforgeable. `H(payload)` is kept a separable
leaf so a challenge can reveal a packet's structure without its payload,
and so it doubles as the recomputation certificate's public input (P5, P3).

**Certificates are chained.** Each signed body includes the previous
certificate's tag (`prev_τ`), so the certificate stream is a hash chain:
any anchor the verifier holds transitively fixes the entire prior sequence,
and no certificate can be dropped, reordered, or substituted between two
anchors without breaking the chain. Together with `bucket_start ‖
num_buckets` tiling the bucket timeline, this gives one append-only history
per key (C2, C3).

**Commit placement is direction-asymmetric, deliberately** (see the §8
figure): requests are committed **before** the bucket buffer — the
certificate binds what was *accepted into* the quarantine — while responses
are committed **after** it, on the drain side — the certificate binds
exactly the bytes that *left* the quarantine. A response drain preempted at
the tick (§7) therefore never commits its unsent remainder: the attested
outbound log and the wire are identical by construction, which is the
direction where it matters.

**The nonce latch needs no authentication.** The verifier's nonce arrives
as an inbound `id = 0` control packet; `canon_proc` latches its key-commit
field (low 128 bits) and suppresses the packet — it is never forwarded, and
the capture is gated on a non-fractional header so a spliced frame can
never latch one. The device never verifies a MAC: the verifier credits only
nonces it generated, so injected or replayed nonces are indistinguishable
from dropped ones — both read as staleness, the failure the mechanism
exists to expose. The interlock generates MACs but never checks one,
keeping it off the HMAC-oracle surface.

Every hash is recomputed by the device from wire bytes; no prover-supplied
value enters a certificate. Conversely, every certificate field is
deterministic given the accepted stream and the nonce — the prover can (and
does) byte-audit each certificate as it arrives. Certificates are emitted
continuously, unprompted — emission is never a response to a query, so
query timing cannot become a device output.

## 6. Integration with the broader prover system

![Workload path: verifier — prover frontend — interlock — prover compute. Traffic is end-to-end encrypted between frontend and compute; the interlock hash-commits it in transit. At challenge time the ZKP option has prover compute generate the proof π, forwarded with the certificates.](fig-zkp.png){ width=100% }

Division of labor around the device:

- **Interlock:** on-the-fly enforcement and certification only. Holds one
  bucket buffer per direction plus running hash state, stores no history,
  answers no queries.
- **Prover frontend:** the untrusted convenience replica. It logs both
  directions' packets, key material, and every certificate for the
  challenge window (~30 days); tracks the device's bucket clock from the
  per-tick **sync packets** (the `FIRST_ARR` field tells it how deep into a
  bucket its probe actually landed — feedback it iterates on to widen its
  send window; at most one sync in flight), so it can declare buckets that
  exact-match; byte-audits each certificate on arrival; and serves
  challenge openings.
- **Verifier:** keeps an **anchor log** of nonce→certificate round trips
  (with receive times on its own clock), verifies the certificate chain and
  bucket tiling, checks counter rate against wall clock, samples challenges
  (§4.4), recomputes every hash over the opened slices, and consumes the
  recomputation certificate for the sampled pair.

**The authority asymmetry** (`verification-protocol.md`, *Two invariants*):
the certificate is the sole authority; the prover's log is best-effort. A
challenge the log cannot satisfy consistently with the certificate is a
failed challenge charged as unexplained information — prover logging
failures degrade the prover's standing, never soundness (§7).

At challenge time, the opened traffic values `(H1_in, H2, H1_out)` bridge
into a **recomputation certificate** attesting the response carries at most
U unexplained bits:

![Prover-recomputation option: the same workload track, plus a challenge-time track — the frontend stages the challenged pair through a second recomputation interlock into the verifier enclosure.](fig-prover-recomp.png){ width=100% }

The recomputation interlock (`recomp_ilock_core`) is a structural sibling
of the production core with one challenge direction: the frontend stages
the challenge slice through the same deframe → canon_proc → commit →
bucket-buffer path, then **`recomp_feed`** forwards the context into the
enclosure and runs the challenged response as an **estimate/reveal loop** —
the enclosure commits a probability estimate for each position *before*
that position's token is revealed; the device checks each estimate is a
valid sub-distribution (a malformed or missing estimate is charged at the
value space's maximum surprisal, so cheating never under-charges),
accumulates the running total `Û` over length, timing, and every token, and
feeds `Û` plus its own ingress digest to `cert_build`.

It needs no traffic *timeline* — no epochs, no persisted counter; its
certificate binds to the challenge nonce. But it is **not stateless**: its
certificate must attest to *exactly what information entered the recompute
node prior to each step*, which is inherently session state — the ingress
traffic digest since enclosure seal/wipe, the commit-before-reveal ordering,
and the `Û` accumulator. Without that state, a covert payload staged into
the enclosure before or between predictions could be laundered as
"explained." Reset of the recomputation device mid-session must abort the
session, never resume it. (The recomputation certificate format is still a
placeholder in RTL — see §11.)

## 7. Fault tolerance

The design principle is **fail closed toward soundness, degrade gracefully
toward availability**: no failure mode may yield a false certificate or an
ambiguous timeline; failures instead cost traffic, prover standing, or (in
the limit) the device's ability to certify at all.

- **Restarts never rewind the timeline.** The key survives power cycles
  (PUF-wrapped in sNVM, §2), so uniqueness cannot rest on state
  evaporating; it rests on a **persisted monotonic epoch counter** with
  never-rewind boot logic. The counter is written to sNVM every `W` epochs;
  on boot the device resumes at `persisted + W` (a safety margin past any
  epoch it could have certified), so no epoch is ever certified twice (C2)
  even across arbitrary power cycles. The restart itself is unhideable: the
  skipped epochs are a gap in the certificate chain and bucket tiling,
  which the verifier treats as unattested time — worst-case information
  charge for the gap, or grounds for re-inspection (policy, not mechanism).
  Rolling the persisted counter back would require rewriting authenticated
  sNVM inside the device's security boundary — the same trust as key
  storage itself. Active tamper (detector-triggered) escalates to
  zeroization: key death, ending the stream permanently. *(This
  key/counter-persistence layer is design; the RTL currently takes the key
  on a port — §11.)*
- **Bucket boundaries never wait.** The tick is free-running; `canon_proc`
  moves to the new bucket the instant it fires, independent of downstream
  backpressure, and signals the boundary in-band as an unambiguous empty
  beat. Congestion can delay *packets*, never *time*.
- **Buffer admission and preemption.** The admission guard stalls a packet
  at its first beat rather than letting a record straddle banks; if the
  guard is ever violated, the in-flight record is abandoned rather than
  half-committed. A drain still running at the next tick is preempted: a
  termination beat closes the cut stream and the remainder is dropped —
  and because responses are committed on the drain side (§5), a preempted
  remainder is neither released nor attested. Loss is always visible to
  the endpoints, never absorbed silently into commitments.
- **Honest drops are avoidable and non-fatal.** Exact-match buckets drop
  boundary-straddling declarations; the honest frontend avoids this by
  calibrating against the sync packets' `FIRST_ARR` feedback and not
  sending within a guard window of the tick. A drop that happens anyway
  loses one packet's traffic; it never corrupts a certificate. Recovery is
  the endpoints' job via a new request.
- **Sync-packet loss is harmless.** At most one is in flight; the
  frontend's calibration loop free-runs between syncs and re-anchors on the
  next one. A mis-synced sender only mis-declares and drops itself —
  visible to it, irrelevant to soundness.
- **Prover storage loss degrades to U.** A missing or corrupt log slice,
  certificate copy, or reference-chain link makes the corresponding
  challenge unanswerable-consistently — charged as unexplained information.
  No special repair path exists or is needed.
- **Recomputation-side faults never under-charge.** A malformed estimate,
  a failed normalization check, or a truncated estimate frame charges the
  position at the minimum representable probability (at least the value
  space's max entropy); the loop continues — no fault, no abort, no
  discount.

## 8. Information flow through the device

![Information flow through the production interlock core (fabric_bridge). Both directions are sanitized, checked, and staged through bucket-quantized ping-pong buffers straddling the quarantine boundary; requests are hash-committed as accepted (before the buffer), responses as released (after it). Both digests, the latched nonce, and the previous tag feed cert_build, whose chained certificate frames join the frontend-bound mux; per-tick sync packets flow back to each direction's own sender.](fig-interlock-blocks.png){ width=100% }

Components, in datapath order (all `gateware/src/src_hdl/` on `main`):

| Block | Role | Security relevance |
|---|---|---|
| MAC/PHY (CoreTSE ×2) | L1/L2 per port; FCS check | Vendor IP at the edge; everything it passes is re-validated in fabric |
| `eth_deframe` / `eth_reframe` | 802.3 sanitization: force DST/SRC, enforce LENGTH, strip PAD; re-originate with fresh headers + recomputed FCS | Metadata removal (§3): only canonical DATA crosses |
| `canon_proc` (+ `axis_pkt_gate`) | Header shift-register: length, id, reference, reserved, **bucket** checks; in-band boundary markers, nonce capture (`id = 0`), sync emission (`id = 1`); gate suppresses payload-check failures | Enforces §4.1 — the premises of the reconstruction argument; drops are silent |
| `traffic_commit` (`record_layer`, `serializer`, `sha256_msg`) | Per-packet record → running bucket digest → epoch digest; rate-matched, never back-pressures the datapath | The commitment hierarchy (§5); requests as accepted, responses as released |
| `batch_buffer` | Ping-pong banks; swap exactly at tick; admission guard; drain preemption | Timing isolation (§3): outside sees only changeover snapshots |
| `cert_build` (+ `crypto/`: `sha256_core`, `sha256_msg`, `hmac_sha256`) | Assemble `m`, `τ = HMAC_k(m)`, emit the 0-id certificate frame; `prev_τ` chains certificates | The attestation (§5); the only secret-bearing operation |
| `axis_mux3` / 2×1 mux | Arbitrate forwarded / cert / sync per egress | Fixed, prover-predictable egress set |
| Bucket timer (in `fabric_bridge`) | Free-running 1 ms tick to `canon_proc` + buffers | Authoritative time base; no external set path |
| Key + counter persistence | PUF-wrapped key in sNVM; persisted monotonic epoch counter; tamper → zeroization | Reset resistance (§7); key custody (§2) — **design; RTL takes the key on a port** |
| `recomp_ilock_core` / `recomp_feed` / `norm_chk` | Challenge-time sibling: ingress commit + buffer + estimate/reveal loop + `Û` | The recomputation interlock (§6); session-stateful by design |
| Debug taps (`pkt_counter`, `sticky_bit`; UART telemetry on debug branches) | Bring-up observability | **Must be gated out of production** (§11) |

Assurance: the production blocks carry their own testbenches
(timeline-compressed via the timer parameters); the certificate math is
additionally anchored by the earlier conformance core, which was verified
byte-for-byte against the Python golden model (`prototype/interlock.py`)
under cocotb and independently audited (A-G5). The final gate for any image
is the certificate-byte comparison against the golden model on silicon.

## 9. Security requirements

### Certificate requirements (what the verifier assumes)

| # | Requirement | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| **C1** | **Completeness** | The certificate for epoch `e` commits *every* packet that traversed the interlock during `e`, both directions. No byte crosses uncommitted. |
| **C2** | **Uniqueness (reset resistance)** | Over the lifetime of key `k`, at most one certificate is ever generated for a given epoch. No reset, power cycle, or state rewind may allow an already-certified epoch to be certified again. |
| **C3** | **Continuity (monotonic order)** | Certificates are generated only in strictly increasing epoch order and form an unbroken chain (`prev_τ`) whose `bucket_start` values tile the bucket timeline — no gap or overlap the prover can hide. |
| **C4** | **Freshness** | A certificate echoing verifier nonce `r` was generated after `r` was issued. |
| **C5** | **Bounded worst-case bandwidth** | Per epoch and direction at most `N ×` (bank capacity) committed bytes, and the epoch counter advances at most ~2× wall-clock rate, so elapsed real time caps total volume between checks. Slowdown needs no assumption — it is directly visible in the anchor log. |
| **C6** | **Queryability** | The verifier can audit recent epochs on demand: send a nonce, receive the next certificate echoing it and stamping the current epoch, then challenge any epoch back to the last anchor. |
| **C7** | **Unforgeability** | Only the interlock (and the verifier itself) can produce a valid tag; a certificate accepted under `k` and `interlock_id` originated from that device. |

C2 + C3 give the verifier a single, append-only timeline per key: exactly
one history, fixed before any challenge is known (P2). C4 + C5 anchor it to
wall clock (P4): history cannot be stretched, replayed, or run ahead, and
bursts between checks are bounded. The query pattern exercising C4–C6:
every few days, anchor with a fresh nonce, verify the chain, tiling, and
rate, then challenge a uniformly random epoch from the unaudited interval —
the prover cannot predict which epoch must hold up.

### Device requirements (what upholds them)

| # | Device requirement | Mechanism | Upholds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** | Correct enforcement logic | `canon_proc` checks + gate; commitment pipeline; tested and audited (§8) | C1, C3, C5 (caps), §4's premises |
| **D2** | Information isolation | 802.3 sanitization, bucket-quantized egress, silent drops, sender-directed sync (§3) | C1's converse — nothing escapes commitment |
| **D3** | Binding | record → bucket → epoch → HMAC, all recomputed from wire bytes; `prev_τ` chaining (§5) | C1, C3, C7 |
| **D4** | Tamper-proof, non-rewindable state | Persisted monotonic counter in authenticated sNVM, skip-ahead boot; free-running timer with no set path while powered; tamper → zeroization (§7) | C2, C3, C5 (rate) |
| **D5** | Key protection | PUF-wrapped key at rest in sNVM; phase 2: TeraFire DPA-resistant HMAC (§2) | C7 — and transitively everything |

Summarized: **correct logic, state that cannot be tampered with or
rewound, and a key that cannot be read.**

## 10. Threat table

| Attack | Defense | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Exfiltrate outside packet framing (bypass the wire) | Physical quarantine: interlock is the only network path | scope (§2) |
| Exfiltrate via 802.3 header fields, padding, or malformed frames | Per-field sanitization: forced DST/SRC, enforced LENGTH, neutralized PAD, recomputed FCS | C1 (D2) |
| Exfiltrate via frame segmentation (LENGTH choice) | Accepted residual, charged in unexplained-information accounting (~4 unexplained bytes per covert bit) | P3 |
| Exfiltrate via packet ordering within a bucket | Strictly increasing ids; order is a pure function of content (§4.3) | C1 |

| Exfiltrate via sub-bucket timing | Ping-pong bucket buffers release only at changeover (implemented on `main`; silicon verification pending) | C1 (D2) |
| Exfiltrate via drop patterns or device telemetry | Silent suppression; no drop observables on the production path; **debug taps gated out of production** | C1 (D2) |

| Use the interlock itself as a covert transmitter | Every cert field prover-predictable; sync packets flow only to each direction's own sender; nonce-latch timing ≤1 bit/update; tag release auditable by cut-and-choose | P5 (D2) |

## 11. Residual risks and open items

1. **Silicon verification pending.** The production core (sanitization,
   `canon_proc`, `batch_buffer` timing isolation, chained certs) exists on
   `main` and in testbenches; the currently-flashed image predates it. The
   isolation and certificate claims hold for hardware only after the
   on-silicon certificate-byte and timing-release checks pass.
2. **Debug observability in production.** Bring-up needs counters, sticky
   flags, and (on debug branches) UART telemetry — exactly what D2 forbids
   in deployment. Required: a build-level gate that provably excludes all
   debug taps from a production bitstream.
3. **Phase-1 key custody and counter persistence.** `cert_build` takes the
   key on a port; the PUF/sNVM wrapping, the persisted-counter FSM, and the
   tamper/zeroization hookup are design, not yet built. All current results
   read as "assuming key secrecy," which phase-1 hardware does not yet earn
   against a physical adversary. **sNVM write endurance** constrains the
   persistence cadence `W`: secure-flash pages have limited program cycles,
   so `W` and page wear-leveling must be engineered against the datasheet
   limit (larger `W` costs a larger skipped gap per restart, not soundness).
   *Note — doc drift:* `verification-protocol.md` still describes a
   battery-backed domain (assumption 1) and calls the recomputation
   interlock "stateless"; both should be corrected per §7 and §6. The
   `feature/gateware-core` branch docs (`bucket-declaration-spec.md`,
   `gateware-debug.md`) describe the superseded conformance line.
4. **Working-state tamper-proofness.** The powered running state is assumed
   untouchable (D4). The persisted counter covers *restarts*; active
   probing or glitching of live state relies on the tamper detectors, whose
   coverage against fault injection is deferred to the physical-hardening
   pass, scoped with D5.
5. **Bucket-counter width.** The canonical `bucket` field is 32-bit
   (`canon_pkg.sv`); at 1 ms ticks it wraps after ~49.7 days. The `prev_τ`
   chain keeps the *order* unambiguous across a wrap, but bucket-numbered
   challenge addressing and the C2 "one certificate per epoch number"
   statement need either a wider counter or an explicit wrap/era policy for
   key lifetimes beyond ~7 weeks.
6. **Honest drop rate.** Believed negligible with sync-packet calibration
   and a sender-side guard window; to be measured on silicon.
7. **Speedup bound enforcement.** C5 assumes the device oscillator cannot
   run more than ~2× fast; the enforcement (oscillator choice, on-die clock
   monitoring, or tighter anchor cadence) is not yet specified.
8. **Recomputation certificate format is a placeholder.** `recomp_ilock_core`
   currently emits the production traffic-cert layout with `Û` standing in
   for the response digest; the pinned format
   `(nonce, H1_in, H2, H1_out, n_units, U)` needs its own builder before
   recomputation results are protocol-valid.
