"""infcli — port-0 driver + multi-turn chat frontend for the interlock (#3).

Runs on the client side: the Raspberry Pi on port 0.
It drives one inference packet at a time through the interlock on port 0, captures the
response and the per-packet certificates, verifies the certs locally, and on demand
triggers a zero-knowledge proof IN BAND over the same cable.

The demo flow is the `chat` command: a multi-turn Llama-2-7b conversation where each
turn's request is the whole conversation so far, re-tokenized into one message. Tokens
never leave this side as text — the payload on the wire is the canonical token-id array
(little-endian uint32, inference-cli-app.md §6.3), which is exactly what the certificate
binds and what the proof runs on. Type `/prove` mid-conversation to kick off the proof on
the Spark; status lines stream back in band and a final panel shows the interlock
certificate and the ZK result side by side, proving they cover the *same* input bytes.

Wire contract + cert format: see inference-cli-app.md. The framing and cert parse/verify
here are the exact code verified on silicon (6/6 tau, 6/6 overall). The only platform-
specific part is the raw-Ethernet transport (scapy/libpcap — macOS has no AF_PACKET);
scapy puts the NIC in promiscuous mode, required to receive the interlock's forced MACs.

  pip install scapy transformers          # transformers only for the tokenizer (no torch)

  sudo python3 infcli.py --iface en7 --model ~/models/llama-2-7b-hf chat
  sudo python3 infcli.py --iface en7 send --text "hello"      # low-level bring-up
  sudo python3 infcli.py --iface en7 challenge 3              # proof on an existing rid

HARD: one packet in flight at a time, spaced (per-packet cert HMAC has no back-pressure
— a flood wedges the interlock). The send loop enforces --gap-ms; the Spark spaces its
control replies too.
