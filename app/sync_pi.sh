# WHY THIS EXISTS. The Pi runs the client: it tokenizes, seals the request under
# AES-128-GCM, and is the only side that can open the response. Those files used
# to get there by hand-typed scp, which meant the demo depended on a second
# machine whose contents were outside version control -- nothing recorded which
# revision the Pi was on, and drift stayed invisible until a GCM tag failed and
# looked like a wire fault. This makes the Pi a deployment target of the repo.
#
# The Pi deliberately gets a COPY of the two reference modules from VerInf rather
# than the whole repo: it has no GPU, no torch, and no need for the prover. But a
# copy is a drift risk, which is exactly why --check exists -- run it before a
# demo and the answer is a checksum, not a hope.
