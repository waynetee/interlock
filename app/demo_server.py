"""Spark half of the web demo: orchestrator, Socket.IO hub, and static host.

SHAPE. Two namespaces on one server. `/agent` is the Pi -- exactly one client,
dialing out, holding the certified wire. `/demo` is every browser. The server
owns the beat sequence and relays the Pi's events to the browsers; the browsers
never talk to the Pi.

    browser ──/demo──▶ demo_server ──/agent──▶ pi_agent ══ certified wire ══▶ Spark

WHAT IS AND IS NOT ON THIS LINK. The control link carries commands and metadata.
The prompt and the response cross the certified wire; pi_agent's `_scrub` is what
keeps everything else off the control plane. The one plaintext that comes back is
the decrypted response, emitted by the Pi because the Pi is what holds the key --
which is the point the demo is making, so it is a feature that it cannot come
from here.

MODE. Which prover runs, and at what strength, is deployment config that lives
in the backend service and the ilk_server container, not here; MODE_LABEL (see
below) is how this server is told what to call it, and it rides on every result
so the UI cannot render a verdict without it. As deployed the demo runs the
FAST prover (subsample_challenge.py, tq=1): ~30 s a run, the key binding and
the weld at full strength, the forward pass spot-checked at one (token, layer)
of ~460. Point CHALLENGE_PY at interlock_challenge.py for the full sound proof
(~3.5 min), and relabel to match.

Run:  VerInf/venv/bin/python -u demo_server.py --port 8770
