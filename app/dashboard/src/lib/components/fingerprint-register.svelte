	 * Fingerprint register — the /lab bench, wired to the live run.
	 *
	 * Three digests come off a run: the certifier's fingerprint of the request, its
	 * fingerprint of the response, and the commitment to the model weights. Each is
	 * printed as a strip of film. Between them the three own every cell of the ground
	 * and not one cell of the word, so a registered pile closes the ground completely
	 * and the letters stay black.
	 *
	 * The strips are different heights and none of them is cropped, so they have to be
	 * SLID along Y until their patterns seat on the same rows — see $lib/fingerprint-
	 * shares for how the pile divides into a band and two dealt margins. That slide is
	 * the animation: the proof running is the strips hunting for their seat, and the
	 * verdict landing is them settling onto it.
	 *
	 * C is the backing. It is the model commitment, it is full height, and it does not
	 * move — the thing committed in advance is the thing the other two register onto.
	 * B is the output fingerprint, and it is the one the verdict decides: a response
	 * the certifier never fingerprinted is a strip of the right density that no longer
	 * fits the deal, and it is drawn in fault red.
	 *
	 * Nothing below this comment consults the stencil. `composite()` is handed the
	 * strips at their current slide and reports which of them lit each cell; the
	 * picture is whatever comes back. Drop a strip and its third punches straight out
	 * of the ground — that is the only thing holding the word up.
