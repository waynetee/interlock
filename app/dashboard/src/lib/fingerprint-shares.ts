/**
 * Fingerprint shares — one shuffle, cut in three, with the word punched out.
 *
 * ── the construction, in full ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   1. mark the cells the word covers
 *   2. deal every OTHER cell out round-robin to A, B and C
 *
 * That is the whole thing. Each sheet holds exactly a third of the ground and not one
 * cell of the word, so laying the three over one another fills the ground completely
 * and leaves the word black. The stack is the union, cell for cell — no subcells, no
 * threshold, no second resolution. What is on screen is what the sheets are.
 *
 * The three are interchangeable. Same size, same statistics, none of them special:
 * whichever one you take away, a third of the ground goes dark with it.
 *
 * ── where the digests actually come in ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Less far than the panel's labels suggest, and it is worth being exact about it.
 *
 * The shuffle is seeded by the REQUEST digest, and it has to be seeded by something
 * that exists before any sheet is drawn — the register puts sheet A on the table
 * while the response is still being generated, so the deal is already settled by
 * then. It cannot depend on digests that have not happened yet.
 *
 * So: the request digest fixes the deal. Each digest then sets its own sheet's
 * brightness texture. And the model digest decides the one thing the verdict turns
 * on — whether sheet C is the third it was dealt, or a random handful that fits
 * nothing. What no digest does is choose its own cells independently of the others:
 * three sets chosen independently would not tile anything.
 *
 * ── what this costs, stated plainly ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A single sheet is a third dense over the ground and empty over the word, so the
 * word is faintly there in each one, as an absence. That is forced, not sloppy. A
 * stack that is COMPLETELY black over the letters means no sheet lit a letter cell,
 * and a sheet that never lights a letter cell has a hole shaped like the word.
 *
 * Hiding that hole is what subcell expansion buys, and it costs the thing that was
 * wanted more: with expansion the letters can only ever be a third lit rather than
 * black, and getting them back to black needs a threshold pass. This file takes the
 * other side of that trade — a true black word in a true solid ground, read straight
 * off the cells, at the price of a legible ghost in each sheet.

 *   bottom margin  slack rows, inked by B and C between them
 *
 * Each margin is a partition, exactly like the ground is: every cell in the top
 * margin goes to A or to C and never both, so the two together cover it completely
 * and neither has to be solid. `share` is how much of that goes to the sliding strip.
 * The backing carries the rest, which at a half-and-half split is half the ink a
 * solid margin needed and reads as a field rather than a slab.
 *
 * The strips fall out of that with no freedom left in them:
 *
 *   A   [ top margin | pattern ]     rows + slack tall, sits at pile row 0
 *   B   [ pattern | bottom margin ]  rows + slack tall, sits at pile row slack
 *   C   [ margin | pattern | margin ] full height, does not move
 *
 * ── what that costs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The earlier cut hid where each pattern sat by surrounding it with decoy at the
 * pattern's own density, and picked the position from a digest. Neither survives:
 * the extents are now structural, so A's pattern is always directly below its margin
 * and B's directly above its own. Registration is aligning three edges, not finding
 * three positions.
 *
 * `share` is the one dial left on that. At 0.5 the margins are denser than the
 * pattern band, so each sliding strip has a visible step where one ends and the other
 * begins. At 1/3 the margin matches the band and the strip is uniform top to bottom —
 * the band is no longer advertised by its own density, though the strip's ends still
 * say where it must go. Looks against hiding, and the hiding was never worth much:
 * a handful of slides, and every strip carries the word's ghost regardless.
