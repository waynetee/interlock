	/**
	 * Interlock — the case.
	 *
	 * Driven by demo_server.py (interlock/app), which orchestrates a Raspberry Pi
	 * holding the certified wire and a Spark running the model behind a PolarFire
	 * FPGA that fingerprints every packet in both directions. Every value rendered
	 * here arrived over that wire. The only thing this file invents is the pacing.
	 *
	 * ...unless the board is off, in which case it invents everything — see
	 * `simulate()`. That path exists so the demo survives a dead board, and it says
	 * so on screen in a strip that is never dismissible, because a rehearsal that
	 * cannot be told apart from a run is worse than no rehearsal.
	 *
	 * WHO IS READING THIS. A panel in the lid of a case, seen standing up from a few
	 * feet by someone who has not been briefed. One screen, no scroll, and nothing
	 * static: no title, no headings, no explainer copy. The picture IS the
	 * explanation — the question itself rides the cable, seals into its real
	 * ciphertext bytes and opens again; the certifier stamps a fingerprint out of
	 * each passing packet and RACKS IT INSIDE ITS OWN BODY; only when the proof
	 * begins do the films slide into the GPU cluster and combine there, beside the
	 * model's own commitment, because that is where the proof actually runs. The
	 * numbers an engineer wants are on the console and in /lab.
