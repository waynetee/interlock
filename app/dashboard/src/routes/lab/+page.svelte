	 * /lab — the share bench.

	 * Three sheets, A B C. Each lights a third of the panel; between them they own
	 * every cell of the ground and not one cell of the word. Stack them and the ground
	 * closes while the letters stay black — and that stack is the picture, cell for
	 * cell, with no threshold pass and no second resolution anywhere in it.
	 *
	 * The bench exists so the claim can be checked rather than taken: switch a sheet
	 * off and watch its third punch straight out of the ground.
	 *
	 * Nothing here consults the stencil to decide what to draw. `union()` is handed
	 * whichever sheets are switched on and counts light; the picture is whatever comes
	 * back. MASK appears in one place only, in the measurements panel, and only to
	 * score a picture that was already drawn.

					The ground is dealt out a cell at a time, so all three sheets are load bearing: switch one
					off and its third goes black where it stood, which is the holed ground above rather than a
					blank panel.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground/70">
					Nothing here is cropped. There is no aperture you could hold against three pieces of film
					— you stack them and you move them — so the panel is the whole pile. It divides in three:
					a top margin dealt between A and the backing, the band where all three carry the picture,
					and a bottom margin dealt between B and the backing. Each margin is a partition exactly
					like the ground is, so the two strips that share it cover it completely and neither has to
					be a solid block.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground/70">
					The extents are structural, so nothing hides where a pattern sits: A's is always under its
					margin and B's always over its own, and registering is aligning three edges rather than
					finding three positions. SPLIT is the one dial left on that — at 33 each margin matches
					the band's own density and a sliding strip is uniform top to bottom, at 50 the three
					strips weigh about the same in ink. The hiding was never worth much anyway: every strip
					carries the word's ghost regardless.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-caution/80">
					The word being <em>completely</em> black in the stack means no sheet lit a single cell of it
					— so each sheet has a hole shaped like the word, and you can find it if you look. That is forced,
					not sloppy: hiding the hole needs subcell expansion, and expansion is what puts a third of the
					light back into the letters.
