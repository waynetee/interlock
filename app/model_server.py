"""Spark port-1 model-server + in-band ZK control handler for the interlock (#2).

Sits on the prover-compute side (interlock PORT 0 / J15 = enP7s7). The interlock forwards
canonical packets here (DST=server 02:..:02, SRC=client 02:..:01). Two kinds, told apart
by a magic PAYLOAD prefix (so control isn't mistaken for an inference request):

  * INFERENCE request  -> generate() -> response packet back out the compute port
  * ZK CONTROL message -> handle_challenge() -> status/result packets back out the compute port

Driving the ZK challenge in-band over the interlock cable means no out-of-band (WiFi)
channel: only small control messages travel — the proof is generated AND verified here
on the Spark (verify-on-Spark) and never crosses the wire.

Wire contract (inference-cli-app.md §2): 802.3 LENGTH frames; packet = [16B header]
[payload]. Control payload = MAGIC(8) || type(1) || body_len(2 BE) || body.

HARD: one packet in flight at a time, spaced (per-packet cert HMAC has no
back-pressure). Inference answers one at a time; control replies are spaced by CTL_GAP.
