# Cold-boot the interlock demo, from powered-off to a working screen.
#
# Written as a script rather than a checklist so it cannot drift from reality:
# every step below is the step that actually runs. It is idempotent -- safe to
# re-run at any point, and safe to run when things are already up.
#
#   ./demo_cold_start.sh          # fast mode (the demo), ~90 s to ready
#   ./demo_cold_start.sh sound    # full four-round proof, ~110 s per run
#   ./demo_cold_start.sh check    # preflight only, change nothing
#
# BEFORE running, physically:
#   1. Power the interlock board. It boots from flash; nothing to load.
#      Power-cycle it even if it looks on -- it goes quiet a few hours after
#      power-up and the symptom is a demo that fails at the first request.
#   2. Cables:  Pi eth0 -> RJ45 J30 (port 1, client, certificates)
#               Spark   -> RJ45 J15 (port 0, compute)
#      Swapping these silently breaks the demo: the verifier lands on the
#      compute link and no certificates reach it.
#   3. Power the Spark, then the Pi. The Pi joins the Spark's own AP
#      (SSID 2a-spark, autoconnect priority 10) with no venue network needed.

#                     i.e. a power cycle of the interlock.
#   wire half wedged-- frames ARE arriving (1000 sync/s), but canon_tx's servo
#                     saturated, its re-bootstrap failed, and every request now
#                     dies with "send() before bootstrap()". It never self-heals.
#                     Restarting ilk_server fixes it in ~25 s.

# it is the ground truth for "is anything on the cable" -- before blaming the board.
