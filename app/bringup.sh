# TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat is the demo model. Sense-checked on five prompts it

# answered 1/5 -- it only knows the memorised "capital of France" and otherwise
# emits nonsense, so it cannot survive an unrehearsed question.
#
# It is also FASTER than llama-3.2-1b despite having more layers (22 vs 16):
#   TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat   102 s @ tq=10   263 s @ tq=80
#   llama-3.2-1b          122 s @ tq=10   357 s @ tq=80
# because proof cost tracks VOCABULARY and DEPTH, not parameter count -- the LM
# head is d x V, and 32000 vs 128256 makes it 4x cheaper. It also stops at 8
# tokens instead of padding to 24, shrinking SEQ.
#
# Any replacement must be LlamaForCausalLM with hidden_act=silu: the prover has
# a SiluClaim and no GELU equivalent, so Gemma (GeGLU), Qwen2 (QKV bias) and
# Phi need new claim types on BOTH the Python and Rust sides.

# is linear in it: T ~= 137 s + 2.95 s * tq (measured on llama-3.2-1b, 12-token

# weights live in a persistent block committed once across proofs (Variable
# .persistent). It is the depth-independent claims (embedding + LM head), model
# load, and the ~13 s JSON proof dump. Shortening the response is NOT a useful
# speed lever -- cutting 24 -> 8 response tokens saved only 10%, and it changes
# U (U is summed over response positions).
